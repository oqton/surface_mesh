Surface_mesh uses CMake as its build configuration system. For
Unix-like system follow these instructions to configure and build
Surface_mesh:

# create a build directory
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

# configure CMake
$ cmake ..

# build
$ make

# install
$ sudo make install

Upon installation, both the library and headers will be installed
to the directory given via CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, which defaults
to /usr/local/ on Unix-like systems. If you need to install to a
custom location set the install prefix during build
configuration:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your custom path> ..

In order to compile the included examples configure CMake with

$ cmake -DWITH_EXAMPLES=true ..

In order to build the full HTML manual and reference
documentation call

$ make doxygen

and start reading the manual at doc/index.html.
